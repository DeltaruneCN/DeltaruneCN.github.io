					<h3 class="faq-header">Questions About The Game</h3>
					<p class="question">How does this game relate to UNDERTALE? Is it a sequel?</p>
					<p class="answer">Please don't worry too much about that.<br>Essentially, this is not the world of UNDERTALE.<br>If
						you completed UNDERTALE, the ending and world are as you left it.<br>If everyone was happy there, the people in
						the UNDERTALE world will still be happy.<br>So, please don't worry about those characters, and that world. It
						will remain untouched.<br><br>To rephrase that, DELTARUNE's world is a different one.<br>With different
						characters, that have lived different lives.<br>A whole new story will happen...<br><br>I don't know what you
						call this kind of game.<br><br>It's just a game you can play after you complete UNDERTALE, if you want to.<br><br>That's
						all.</p>
					<p class="question">So there's no connections between the two games?</p>
					<p class="answer">It's a different world that might even have different rules.<br><br>That doesn't mean there
						will be no connections at all though.</p>
					<p class="question">When will more chapters come out? There's only Chapter 1 right now.</p>
					<p class="answer">I have no method of estimating that but at least several years.<br>Let's say 4000 years.<br>Actually,
						in the time of answering this question it went up to 4001 years.</p>
					<p class="question">Will you add anything else to the DEMO?</p>
					<p class="answer">I don't think so.<br><br>It's possible Chapter 1 might receive some changes upon the release of
						the game, but I'm not sure.</p>
					<p class="question">How many endings are there?</p>
					<p class="answer">One.</p>
					<p class="question">Then doesn't that mean nothing I do matters?</p>
					<p class="answer">There's something more important than reaching the end.</p>
					<p class="question">I found some kind of bug, will you fix it?</p>
					<p class="answer">There's an e-mail you can send it to. You should probably mention what you were playing on.<br><br>I
						hid the e-mail address somewhere in this world.<br><br>See if you can find it.</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 40px">deltarune</h3>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 10px">at</h3>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 40px">fangamer.com</h3>
					<p>Oh... I didn't hide it very well.</p>
					<p class="question">Will there be any more ports of the game?</p>
					<p class="answer">I'll ask the people that do the ports for me.<br><br>(Goes into the other room and comes back)<br><br>OK
						I asked them and they said no.</p>
					<p class="question">Can I buy the soundtrack for Chapter 1?</p>
					<p class="answer">Yes! You can buy it at <a href="https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/deltarune-chapter-1-original-game-soundtrack/1443475587">iTunes</a>.
						And other forms of distribution will be in the works too.</p>
					<p class="question">Any closing remarks?</p>
					<p class="answer">Thanks for playing my game. I hope you liked it.<br><br>For the past 3 years I've been waking
						up in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep because I've been thinking about the scenes that happen
						in the game.<br><br>Even though so many details are still hazy,<br><br>I really want to show you the things I've
						been thinking about.<br><br>That's really my only reason for making this game.<br><br>If I don't show you what
						I'm thinking, I'll lose my mind.<br><br><br><br>By the way, I was really worried at first about making this.<br><br>The
						expectations for my next work would be really high, so high that I knew that no matter what I did, I felt like
						people would be underwhelmed.<br><br>If you played "UNDERTALE," I don't think I can make anything that
						replicates the exact feelings you had then.<br><br>However, it's possible I can make something else.<br><br>It's
						sort of simple but maybe you'll like it.<br><br>See you in ?? years... OK?<br><br>Don't forget.</p>
